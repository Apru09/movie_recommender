# movie_recommender


This is a movie recommender model which is using Content based filtering to recommend movies to the user.
This model specifically used bag of words approach to group words with high frequency. 
Then, it can be used to find similarities between a movie and all other movies in the list.


I am adding the link to datasets here::

Additionally, for frontend modelling, you need pickle files. I have added one pkl file.
Also for similarity you need a pkl file, which you can do it by reference in the app.py and movieRecommender.ipynb

Sorry for inconvenience (GIT LFS storage limit is 100 MB which I already used -_-)

Thank you!!
